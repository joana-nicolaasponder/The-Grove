### **1. Narrative / Core Loop**

- Narrative: You wander into a quiet autumn grove. A single tree stands in the grove. You feel tired. The autumn leaves are falling. You see beautiful sparkly fireflies. You want to collect them. You feel like you should so you start moving around the grove, hoping the light from the fireflies will help light up your world. But the more you move, the more the world around you dims. The more tired you feel. The more pressured you feel to move, because you should be productive. You should be catching those fireflies. When you rest, the grove slowly restores itself, blossoming in response to your stillness. - The game is about letting go of guilt, honoring rest, and witnessing beauty emerge from pause.
    
- Core Loop: - **move → world dims, anxiety rises → choose to rest → world brightens, grove blossoms → repeat**

### **2. Problem / Motivation**

- For players: Create a poetic space that reflects the feeling of needing to push through fatigue and the relief of surrender. Show that doing less (resting) is not only valid but also necessary.
    
- For me: Explore how to convey an emotional season through mechanics, art, and sound. Practice telling a deeply personal truth with minimal interaction. 
    
- Why now: In a culture of constant productivity, many of us need reminders that rest is regenerative. This resonates with our own creative cycles and inner autumns

### **3. Player Story**

- As someone who struggles with constant doing, I want to experience a space where I can explore the urge to be productive and discover what happens when I choose rest instead.
- As a person who feels guilty about pausing, I want to feel that stillness creates beauty so that I can internalize permission to rest.  
- As someone caught in productivity culture, I want to leave this experience with more gentleness toward my own need for rest and renewal.

### **4. Requirements**

  

**Must have:**

- Player sprite with idle and resting states
- Fireflies/shiny collectibles
- Anxiety mechanic (movement drains color / harmony)
- Rest mechanic (stillness restores color / blossoms)
- At least 3-4 visual stages of grove blossoming
- Dynamic sound layers: noise/anxiety vs harmony/beauty


**Nice to have:**

- Short affirmations during deep rest
- Ambient effects unlocked by rest milestones
- Bloom "chime" sounds on each milestone
- Subtle weather/leaf particles

### **5. Success Metric**

- Qualitative: Players describe the experience as reflective or emotional. They can resonate with the story/the feeling we are trying to convey through the short game. They feel the permission to rest, the weight and effect that rest can carry.
    
- Quantitative:
	- Average play session lasts at least through to 2 blooms
	- Players move so much that the screen is dimmed and shaking before they realize that they can rest.

### **6. Risks / Open Questions**

- How to balance too little gameplay (boring) vs too much
- How to keep resting engaging without adding goals
- Will the message land without being overly explained?
- How minimal can art and sound be while still carrying emotional weight?
